Have you ever wished for a smart YouTube assistant that runs locally, understands your queries, and fetches the right insights instantly? Well, youâ€™re in the right place! ðŸš€

> **Note**: This blog assumes you know basic JavaScript. The required code is in the associated [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vetri15/langchain_demo).

## Overview

The following steps happen in sequence once the user inputs his YouTube link and the question.

-   The YouTube transcript is fetched using the Langchain library.
-   The fetched transcript is broken into text chunks and indexed in Pinecone DB.
-   From the Pinecone DB, the chunks relevant to the question are retrieved.
-   The relevant chunks and the question are sent to the locally running LLM.
-   The LLM does its magicâœ¨ and gives the output to the user.

<!-- **1. Folder Structure**

In smaller React.js projects, simplicity is key. Consider the following folder structure:

```bash:Folder-Structure
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

-   **components**: Store your reusable UI components here.
-   **pages**: Define your main application pages.
-   **utils**: Place utility functions and helper modules here.
-   **App.js**: The main application entry point.
-   **index.js**: The entry point of your application.

**2. Component Organization**

Keep your components organized by functionality. For example, if you have a "Header" component, place it in the `components` folder. Use self-contained components that are easy to understand and maintain.

**3. State Management**

For smaller projects, you can manage state using React's built-in state or `useState` hook. Avoid overcomplicating things with external state management libraries like Redux. -->

## Prerequisites

To run this project you need 2 things apart from the GitHub repo.

**1. Pinecone API key**
You can sign up for a free API key using this link

As your project grows, consider a more modular structure:

```bash:Folder-Structure
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ containers/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

-   **components**: Split components into folders by feature.
-   **containers**: Place container components here for managing data and interactions.
-   **services**: Add API services and external integrations here.

**2. State Management**

For mid-size projects, consider using a state management library like Redux or Mobx. Centralize your application state for better scalability and data management.

**3. Code Splitting**

Leverage code splitting to load only the necessary code for each route, improving performance. React Router offers easy integration with code splitting.

## Overview

**1. Folder Structure**

In large-scale React.js projects, a more organized structure is essential for maintainability:

```bash:Folder-Structure
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ containers/
â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”œâ”€â”€ state/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â””â”€â”€ index.js
```

-   **assets**: Store static assets like images and fonts here.
-   **layouts**: Define layouts for different sections of your app.
-   **state**: Use a modular approach to state management. Each module handles its own state, actions, and reducers.

**2. Routing**

Implement a robust routing system using React Router to manage complex navigation in large apps. Create nested routes for better organization.

**3. Testing and Documentation**

Invest in thorough testing and documentation to ensure code quality and make it easier for your team to collaborate on a large-scale project.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these best practices and tips, you can efficiently structure your React.js projects, ensuring they remain maintainable and scalable as they grow. Tailor your project structure to its size and complexity, and always aim for clean, organized code that promotes collaboration among your development team.
